<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

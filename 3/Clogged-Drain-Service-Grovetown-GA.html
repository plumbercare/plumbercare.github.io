As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

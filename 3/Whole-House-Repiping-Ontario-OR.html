It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

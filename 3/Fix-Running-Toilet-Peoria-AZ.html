<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide years of protection. There are lots of local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.

<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

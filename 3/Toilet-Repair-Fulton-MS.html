Exemptions, which are approved in extremely uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a threat to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

<h3>High Pressure Hydro-Jetting in Riverdale Georgia</h2>
<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>

<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it immediately ends up being a serious safety threat. Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it might trigger a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside becomes ignited. If an individual understands that they have burst a gas line, the first top priority is to shut off the supply of natural gas and call the energy company.</p>
<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

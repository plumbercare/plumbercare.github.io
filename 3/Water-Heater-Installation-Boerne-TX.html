As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized.

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

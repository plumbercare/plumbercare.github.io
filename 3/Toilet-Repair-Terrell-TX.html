You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.

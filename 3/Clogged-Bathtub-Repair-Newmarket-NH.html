<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm.

When these parts wear, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm.

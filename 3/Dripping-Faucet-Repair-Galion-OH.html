<p>One typical way for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue could spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in individual residences, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>

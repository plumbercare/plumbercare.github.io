Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day expenditures and frustrations incurred by difficult water, a water softener is eventually a financial investment that will save you a considerable amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is significantly surpassed by the cash and energy saved.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

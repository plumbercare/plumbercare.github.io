When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will identify the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog ends up being bigger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining effectively.

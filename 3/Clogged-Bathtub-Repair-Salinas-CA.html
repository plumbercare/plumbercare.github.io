Anticipated to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are created to be resilient and efficient, resisting corrosion and other common problems that can pester other pipeline product types.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

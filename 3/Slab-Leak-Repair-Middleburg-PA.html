<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

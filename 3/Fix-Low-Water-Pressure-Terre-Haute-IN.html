<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>

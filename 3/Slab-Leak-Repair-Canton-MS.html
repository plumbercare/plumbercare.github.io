The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water main. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

Cold showers? High energy expenses? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to profit of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>No hot water-- The absence of warm water is the biggest sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio water heater. You may have sediment that has actually developed up in the system and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower. It's time to consult the professionals if your water heater isn't doing its only task.</p>

<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can end up being used and corroded, leading to leaks. Depending upon the intensity of the situation, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly should be removed and replaced. Parts involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

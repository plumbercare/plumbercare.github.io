As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas a smell often related to rotten eggs. If it occurs, this distinctive aroma permits you to smell a potential leak. If you suspect a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Inhaling leaked gas in an indoor space, such as your home can result in an absence of oxygen in the air and result in hypoxia. That can, in turn, result in serious headache, tiredness, decreased vision, short breaths, and even loss of awareness.

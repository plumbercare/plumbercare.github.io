<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Sahuarita AZ</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building and construction contractors (or their employees). The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the firmness of Woodbury's water. Since it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, hardness can appear as a problem when water is boiled or dried from a drip. It also disrupts soap and cleaning agent use. Individuals with extremely soft water can utilize smaller sized quantities of soap and detergent for washing.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high hazard security assembly.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

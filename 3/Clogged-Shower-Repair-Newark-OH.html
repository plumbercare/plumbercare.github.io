<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

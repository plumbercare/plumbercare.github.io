<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

A deposit of no more than half of the task price quote is normally gathered beforehand and deducted from the overall project cost when it is finished.</p>

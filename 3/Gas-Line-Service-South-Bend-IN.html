The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for citizens. A PE or RA can assist determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>

<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result.

It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

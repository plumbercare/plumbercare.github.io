This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater.

As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.

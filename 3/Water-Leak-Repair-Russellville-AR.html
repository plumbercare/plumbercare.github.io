<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

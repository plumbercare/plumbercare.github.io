<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that a disposal is not like the numerous basic house improvement projects around the house.

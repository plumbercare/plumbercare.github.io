<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their workers).

This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "hard" depends on the existence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no adverse effects and are, in truth, necessary everyday nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the rejuvenating taste many individuals find desirable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of detergents and soaps. At this moment the water is stated to be tough.</p>
<p>The majority of automobiles have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines connecting at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine.

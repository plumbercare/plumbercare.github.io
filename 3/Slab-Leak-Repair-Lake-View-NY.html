<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

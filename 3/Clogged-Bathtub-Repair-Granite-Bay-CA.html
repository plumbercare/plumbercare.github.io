<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

This service warranty disclaims without limitation suggested warranties of merchantability or physical fitness for a particular function or treatment of certain water conditions. Whether you need to prepare food, wash your hands, take in the shower or a hot bath, or just mop the floor, both your household water heater and the flow of natural gas contribute essential elements to your family's level of daily comfort and benefit.</p>

If that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue could spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in private residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the general public water system.</p>

You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.

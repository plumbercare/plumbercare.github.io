<p>Leaks are tricky.

<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.

Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

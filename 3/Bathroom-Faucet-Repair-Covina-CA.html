<p>This is among the main and very first questions that you should ask yourself when it concerns repiping and changing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is a vital component to understand whether or not you must repipe your home.

If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. Opportunities are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your home was built decades before that.</p>

When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water supplies.</p>

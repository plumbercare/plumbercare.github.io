<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide.

If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

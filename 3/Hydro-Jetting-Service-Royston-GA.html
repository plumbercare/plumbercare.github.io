<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which might carry dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a number of situations that may draw water from places such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is linked to any outside water source, Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal appropriately, producing waste and a higher water costs.</p>

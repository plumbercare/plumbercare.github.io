<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

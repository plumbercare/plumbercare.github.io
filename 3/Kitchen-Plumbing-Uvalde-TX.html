<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

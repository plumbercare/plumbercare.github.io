<p>The sewer camera inspection permits you to in fact see the interior condition of the drain line. It also lets you see the material the drain line is made from.

Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.

<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed during building of a brand-new or remodelled structure is set up by educated artisans in accordance with suitable codes.

Blockages in a component can cause damaging damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>

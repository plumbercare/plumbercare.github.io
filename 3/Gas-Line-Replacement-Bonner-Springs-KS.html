A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

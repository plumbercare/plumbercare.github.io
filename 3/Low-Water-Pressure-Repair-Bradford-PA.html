<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>

Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

Not to point out plumbing code may be violated without proper backflow prevention.</p>

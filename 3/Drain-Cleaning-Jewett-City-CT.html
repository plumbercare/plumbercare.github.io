<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and might in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is actually a harmless germs that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home.

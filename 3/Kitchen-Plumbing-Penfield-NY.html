<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are simple to utilize and economical, but they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
<p>When a plumbing license has been released in error because of inaccurate, insufficient or unreliable information, or the work for which the authorization was provided violates the Uniform Code, such permit shall be withdrawed or suspended until such time as the license holder demonstrates that all work completed and all work proposed will be in compliance with appropriate provisions of the code.</p>

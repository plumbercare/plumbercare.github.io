<p>This type of valve is used on farming locations. It is suggested to keep the local water supply clean in the existence of different farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. Using these items is called chemigation. There are a number of components to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which permits circulation in just one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last element is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are introduced to go downstream of the check valve.</p>

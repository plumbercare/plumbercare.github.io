Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>

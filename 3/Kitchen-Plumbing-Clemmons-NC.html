The reasons for this can range from leaks, defective or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed concerns, a repair or replacement of the elements might suffice. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place often, then a hot water heater replacement is essential.</p>

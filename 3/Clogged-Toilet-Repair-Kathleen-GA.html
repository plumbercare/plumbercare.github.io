<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Kathleen GA 31047</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can cause a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a personal water supply goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can cause typical circulation to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>

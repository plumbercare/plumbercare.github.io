<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

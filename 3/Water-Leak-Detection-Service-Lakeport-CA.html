<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.

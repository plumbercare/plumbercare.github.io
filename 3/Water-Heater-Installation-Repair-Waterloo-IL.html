<p>Remember that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you must just employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it doesn't go into the control system. Although little pieces of sediment might get through a drip leg.</p>

Backflow can happen in a number of scenarios that may draw water from places such as garden water fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. If it is linked to any outdoors water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

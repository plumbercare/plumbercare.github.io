<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

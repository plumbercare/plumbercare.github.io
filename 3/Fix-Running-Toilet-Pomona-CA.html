Because of the age of the house and location of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing annual forward flow tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to only attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>

That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that flows through the softener.

It is important that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions other than directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who sets up gas piping on home not under their ownership must possess a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need a license and inspection.</p>

<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

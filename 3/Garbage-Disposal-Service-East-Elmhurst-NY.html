<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly should be checked to identify what is in need of repair.

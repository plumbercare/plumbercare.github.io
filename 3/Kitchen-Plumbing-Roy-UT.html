<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or irreversible connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Examine avoids backflow caused by pressure increases in the down stream plumbing. While many plumbers expect payment on the day of service, or in a prompt way once they have actually sent an invoice, lots of plumbing contractors need that you pay a deposit upfront.

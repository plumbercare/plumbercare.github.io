Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

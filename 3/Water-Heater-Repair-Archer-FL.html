Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of backflow systems: air space (AG) and reduced pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that each person utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day.

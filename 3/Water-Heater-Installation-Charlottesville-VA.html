Nevertheless, we more than happy to discuss what you want to obtain from a disposal and guarantee that we offer the right solution.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>

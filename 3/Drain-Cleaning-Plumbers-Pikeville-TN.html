I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

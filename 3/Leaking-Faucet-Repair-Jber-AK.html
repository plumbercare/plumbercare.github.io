<p>Tankless Water Heaters - offer warm water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is warmed as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger.

Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and ought to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

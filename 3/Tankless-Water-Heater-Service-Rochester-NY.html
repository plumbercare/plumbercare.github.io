<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>

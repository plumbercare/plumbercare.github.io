<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

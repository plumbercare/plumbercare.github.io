<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers improves water's taste, but its high cost makes it unwise as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, sometimes, consist of phosphates that damage the environment.

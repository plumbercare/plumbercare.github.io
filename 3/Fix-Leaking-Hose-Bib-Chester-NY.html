<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

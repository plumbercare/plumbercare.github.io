Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and eliminates from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

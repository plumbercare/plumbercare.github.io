<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>

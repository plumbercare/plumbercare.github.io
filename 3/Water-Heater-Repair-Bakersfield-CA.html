The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a residence is because there is too much hair in the shower drain.

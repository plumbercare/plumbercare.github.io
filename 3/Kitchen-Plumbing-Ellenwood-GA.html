<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

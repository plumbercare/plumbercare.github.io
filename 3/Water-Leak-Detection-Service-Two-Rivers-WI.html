<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping material throughout your home repiping project. Copper is standard due to the fact that it's lasting, can make it through fires, and resists weather condition. Nevertheless, copper is tough to install, which indicates higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of flexibility, which implies plumbers can flex the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which saves money and time and minimizes the threat of joint leaks. PEX also resists rust and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>

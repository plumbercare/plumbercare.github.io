Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

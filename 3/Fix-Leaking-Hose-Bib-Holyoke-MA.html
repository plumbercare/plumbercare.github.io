<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in joists, studs, and floorings. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>

Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit can be found in 2 basic types - constant feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to operate the unit. Constant feed is common and the most convenient to use; a batch feed model is safer but can be slower to utilize on big quantities of food waste due to the fact that you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company provides an overview of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

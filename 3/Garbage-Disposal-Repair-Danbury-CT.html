<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help remove them. , if you would like to try the gentlest technique maybe try utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and safety warnings initially!), if that does not do the technique.

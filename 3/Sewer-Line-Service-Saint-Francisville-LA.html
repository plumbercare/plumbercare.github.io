<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

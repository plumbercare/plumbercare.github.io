<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.

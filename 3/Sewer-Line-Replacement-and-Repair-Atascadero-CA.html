Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>

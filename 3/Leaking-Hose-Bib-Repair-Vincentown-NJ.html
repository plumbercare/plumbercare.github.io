<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be set up should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might use up to three weeks or more to process and authorize. Turned down plans need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are badly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Pacoima CA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

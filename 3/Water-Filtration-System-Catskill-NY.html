<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>

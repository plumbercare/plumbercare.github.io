Explore our water softener collection and take pleasure in better water for bathing and home appliances.</p>
<p>High water pressure also damages plumbing. The water entering into the home puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water turned off valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure causes leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without correct pressure reduction.

Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

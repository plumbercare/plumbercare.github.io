<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

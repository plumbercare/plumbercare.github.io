<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

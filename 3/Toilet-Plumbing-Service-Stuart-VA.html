<p>Tankless Water Heaters - offer warm water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing hot water activates the heater and water is warmed as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Because they can hamper the blades, cooking oil and other greases should never be put down the garbage disposal. Finally, cold water ought to be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to ensure that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes.</p>

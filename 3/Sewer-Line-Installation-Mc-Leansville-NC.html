Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

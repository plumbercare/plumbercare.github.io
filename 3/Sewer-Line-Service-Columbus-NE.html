<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see however seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal.

<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

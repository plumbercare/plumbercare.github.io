<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Garland TX 75040</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

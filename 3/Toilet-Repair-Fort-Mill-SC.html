<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Fort Mill SC</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

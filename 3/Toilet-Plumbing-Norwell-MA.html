<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>

<p>If you need a water softener is an individual preference, identifying. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

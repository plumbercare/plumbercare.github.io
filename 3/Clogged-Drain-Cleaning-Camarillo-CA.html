<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Camarillo CA 93010</h3>
<p>If you are seeking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak, first consider your choices. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be needed. Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a much better choice. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near comprehensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can cause a great deal of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.

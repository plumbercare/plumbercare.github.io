<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

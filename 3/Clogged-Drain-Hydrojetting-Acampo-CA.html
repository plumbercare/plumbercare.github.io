Homes built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks connected with lead.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule.</p>

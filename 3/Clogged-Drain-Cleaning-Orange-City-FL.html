Raw sewage is really dangerous and can position severe health threats.</p>
<p>There are different causes for blockages depending on where they take place in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive bathroom tissue for the most part. When the toilet tissue gathers in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet rather of streaming through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl. When our plumber has to eliminate the toilet to unclog the drain correctly, there are times.</p>

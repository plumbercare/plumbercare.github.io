If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or long-term connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions.

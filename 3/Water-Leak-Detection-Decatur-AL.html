<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>

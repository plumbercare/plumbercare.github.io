<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.

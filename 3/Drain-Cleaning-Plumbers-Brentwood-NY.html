Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.

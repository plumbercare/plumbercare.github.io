<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>There's a great chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>

<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and distribution pipes are typically found with nominal pipe sizes from 3‚ÅÑ8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively pricey, and difficult to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>

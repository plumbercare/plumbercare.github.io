<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to assist combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>

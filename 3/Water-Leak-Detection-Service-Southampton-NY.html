<p>Any location water runs through home. This includes sinks, toilets, tubs, lines, and pipes. At this time, the pro will try to find leaks and broken pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will examine water levels, flappers, and filler mechanisms. He or she will eyeball noticeable pipes, and may run a camera inspection to check the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

<p>The heating aspect is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your house. The reasons for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or faulty electrical wiring, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed concerns, a repair or replacement of the elements might be adequate. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring regularly, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

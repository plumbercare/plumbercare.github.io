<p>This might sound like a joke, however it's extremely severe if you wish to really get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting for a copy of the plumbing inspection list. If you're getting a rough-in or final inspection on a building and construction job or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make last modifications prior to inspection day. Stopping working a checkup can mean unpleasant hold-ups in your project.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners wish to get their hands dirty with.

This is even more troublesome if the damage is irreversible or needs more comprehensive repair work, specifically in commercial settings.</p>

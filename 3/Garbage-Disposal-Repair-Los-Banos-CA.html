<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a residence is since there is excessive hair in the shower drain.

<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and simple. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

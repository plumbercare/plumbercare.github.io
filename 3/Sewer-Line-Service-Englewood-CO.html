<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the drinkable water system. The very best method to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>

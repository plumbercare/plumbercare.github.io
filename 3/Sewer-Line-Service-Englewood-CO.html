<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual flow, smell, color or taste. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your house's plumbing system.

<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the drinkable water system. The very best method to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>

<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water supply since it can spread out polluted water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or potential connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow pollutants or toxins to get in the drinkable water supply. Sickness can arise from ingesting water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of piping that are utilized in the repiping process. Due to the fact that of their security, effectiveness and cost, copper piping and PEX piping are used. Copper piping avoids bacteria from growing within the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic product that is both lightweight and flexible.

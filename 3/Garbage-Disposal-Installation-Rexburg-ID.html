<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures in Rexburg ID 83440</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations El Dorado Hills CA</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

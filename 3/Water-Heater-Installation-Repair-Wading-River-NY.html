<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water system and private on-site supply of water and distribution systems by forbiding cross-connections in between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention approaches.

<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the hardness of Woodbury's water.

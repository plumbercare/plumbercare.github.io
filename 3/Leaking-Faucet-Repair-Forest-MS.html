<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that specific reason. But while small drips ought to not be trigger for concern, homeowners should watch on the water heater leaks. I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we required a leak in a pipe fixed. Tom was professional and friendly. He also did the job faster than original estimated, so the work was less expensive than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail beneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place.

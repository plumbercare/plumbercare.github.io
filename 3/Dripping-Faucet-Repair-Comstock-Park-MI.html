<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>There are specific plumbers who concentrate on plumbing related to house remodeling and brand-new construction. When a new home is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be a fantastic prospect for unclogging your toilet, a more specific plumber should be used for house renovating work.</p>

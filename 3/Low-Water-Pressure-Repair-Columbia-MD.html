<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Columbia MD 21044</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>

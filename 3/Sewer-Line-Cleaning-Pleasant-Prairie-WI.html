<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital areas in the assembly.

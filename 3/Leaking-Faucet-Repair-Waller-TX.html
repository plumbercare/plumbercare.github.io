<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

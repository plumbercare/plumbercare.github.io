<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It's important to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and obstructions - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain as well. After completing cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer.

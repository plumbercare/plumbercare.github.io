<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>

<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you need to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils.

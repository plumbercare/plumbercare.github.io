<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Mercedes Texas</h2>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed must have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>

The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This small hole permits water to continually leak out extremely gradually. With time it can result in a significant construct of water.

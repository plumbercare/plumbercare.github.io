<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

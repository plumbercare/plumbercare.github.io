<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there ought to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you must probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Property owners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electrical system is more cost-effective. The answer depends upon your house. While gas models are cheaper to operate, they do need an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electric water heater is generally lower, however it can be more pricey to run. Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>

<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a stable and safe area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing.

<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complex scientific process, however simple to correct. It uses salt to remove odors and minerals found in hard water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that bring in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>

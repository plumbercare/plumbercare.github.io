<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

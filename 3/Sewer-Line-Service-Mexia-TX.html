A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very unusual cases where the structure is considered to not present a danger to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are understandably more concerned about drawing enough water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to accomplish their objective, however fire department cars typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

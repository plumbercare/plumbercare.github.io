<h3>Faucet Leaking in Bayside New York</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Leaks are sly.

If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

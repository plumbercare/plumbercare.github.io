<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

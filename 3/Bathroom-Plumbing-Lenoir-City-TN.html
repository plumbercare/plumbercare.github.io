Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

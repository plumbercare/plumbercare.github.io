<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Warehouse likewise carries a wide variety of backflow prevention devices. These devices consist of backflow prevention system accessories, backflow device enclosures, test kits, repair parts, and insulated pouches.

<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a relentless sewage smell in your home, it is crucial that you call a certified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can pose major health risks.</p>
<p>If you discover any of these signs, you should begin exploring your choices to identify a new hot water heater that best matches your requirements.

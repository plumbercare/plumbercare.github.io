If there is a relentless sewage smell in your home, it is crucial that you call a certified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can pose major health risks.</p>
<p>If you discover any of these signs, you should begin exploring your choices to identify a new hot water heater that best matches your requirements.

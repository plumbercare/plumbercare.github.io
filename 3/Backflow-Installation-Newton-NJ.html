The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

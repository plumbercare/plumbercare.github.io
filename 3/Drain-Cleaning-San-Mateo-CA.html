<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

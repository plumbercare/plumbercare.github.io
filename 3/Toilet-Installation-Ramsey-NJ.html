<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating provides a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger significant problems and damage-- particularly typical in older homes. Using a sewer camera to inspect the weak locations or clog, our extremely trained professionals can quickly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its task-- efficiently transferring wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or municipal system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

<p>With tank warm water heaters, you have a sizeable reservoir that heats and holds water. The heating aspect can be through making use of electricity, gas, or oil. The gas hot water heater make use of natural gas or LPG to warm the water. The gas models are also more economical to operate than the electrical types and are a favorite for residential and commercial functions.

We advise that all water heaters that are 10-15 years old be replaced in order to conserve the property owner time and money in the future.</p>

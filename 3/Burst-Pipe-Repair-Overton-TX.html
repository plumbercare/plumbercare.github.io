Storage tank hot water heater are the most common, and are run with gas. Their style includes an insulated tank where water is heated and stored until needed. Gas hot water heater are more energy efficient and operating expense are minimized by about 50 percent, compared to electrical water heaters. Tank water heaters have a higher initial cost than electrical.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I've talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

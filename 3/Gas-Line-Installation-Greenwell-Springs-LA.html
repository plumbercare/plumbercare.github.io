Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.

<p>Gas is a crucial utility we utilize every day to keep our offices and homes warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the everyday use of gas, it is easy to understand it is reasonable that with time a leak is bound to take place. When a leak appears, it is important to understand the signs, symptoms, and how to act. Keep in mind to take safety measures when handling gas appliances, utilize the previously mentioned signs to determine potential leakages, and call a plumber to have your gas lines frequently inspected and kept.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

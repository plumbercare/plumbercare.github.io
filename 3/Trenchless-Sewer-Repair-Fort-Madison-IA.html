<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Fort Madison IA</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, having a waste disposal unit in fact protects your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food cleaned down a drain unintentionally or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, triggering clogs and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a garbage disposal wash straight down quickly.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. Call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing inspected and we will let you know if a repipe in Brenham is right for you.</p>

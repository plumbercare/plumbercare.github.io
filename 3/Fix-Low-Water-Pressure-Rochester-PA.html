<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water system and private on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of security for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

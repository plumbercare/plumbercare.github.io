<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.

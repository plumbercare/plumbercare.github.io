<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

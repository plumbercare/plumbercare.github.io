<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and disinfected during regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

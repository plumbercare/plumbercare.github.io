<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

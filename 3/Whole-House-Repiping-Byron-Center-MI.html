<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

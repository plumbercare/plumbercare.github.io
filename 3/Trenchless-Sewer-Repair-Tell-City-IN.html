<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>

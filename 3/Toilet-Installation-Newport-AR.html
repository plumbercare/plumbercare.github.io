<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Newport AR</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>

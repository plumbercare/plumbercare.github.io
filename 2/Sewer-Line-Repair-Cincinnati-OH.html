<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To prevent this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>

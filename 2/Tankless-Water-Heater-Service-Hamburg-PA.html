<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly need to be tested to determine what is in need of repair. The field test might not always reveal you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair set are necessary. There might be extra test treatments, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can supply data showing the intensity of the failure that could assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both indoors and underground, DCVs are a little bit more costly however are likewise highly hassle-free, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras work in finding buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to determine appropriate maintenance schedules or the level of necessary repairs.

<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>Add more warm water if it slowly drains away as you work. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a new approach.

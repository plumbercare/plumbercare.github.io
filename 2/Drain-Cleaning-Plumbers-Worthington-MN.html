<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>

<p>Turn the handle counterclockwise if it ends up being difficult to turn; it's most likely you've come across a clog. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain up until you hit resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work a few of the clog free. Pull the auger out occasionally to remove particles till it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

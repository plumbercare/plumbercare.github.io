<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional switched off the water system and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

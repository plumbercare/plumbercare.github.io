<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

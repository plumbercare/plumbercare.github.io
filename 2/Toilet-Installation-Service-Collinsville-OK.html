<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

No problem is undue for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing team does the job quickly and cost effectively.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

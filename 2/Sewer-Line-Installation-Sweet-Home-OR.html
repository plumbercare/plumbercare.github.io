<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

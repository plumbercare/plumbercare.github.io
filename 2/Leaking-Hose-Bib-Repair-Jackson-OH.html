<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation.

<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

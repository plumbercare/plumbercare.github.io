<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Millstadt IL</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>

<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

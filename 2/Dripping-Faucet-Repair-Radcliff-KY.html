<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

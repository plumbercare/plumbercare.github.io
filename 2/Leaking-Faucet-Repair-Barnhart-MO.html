<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

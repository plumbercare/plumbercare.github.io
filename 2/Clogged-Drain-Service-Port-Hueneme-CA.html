<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task since of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

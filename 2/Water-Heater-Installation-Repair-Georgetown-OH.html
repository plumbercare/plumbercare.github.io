If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and after that checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must likewise check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

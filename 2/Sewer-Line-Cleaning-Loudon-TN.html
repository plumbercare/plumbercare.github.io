<p>Homeowners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly sensible to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a new home.

<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation.

Generally, this is since the system is outdated or not working properly. Whatever the reason, you can be losing out on the benefits of soft water without even knowing it.</p>

<p>No, you ought to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system.

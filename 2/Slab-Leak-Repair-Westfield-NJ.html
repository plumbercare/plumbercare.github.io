<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has rusted and decayed over the years if so.

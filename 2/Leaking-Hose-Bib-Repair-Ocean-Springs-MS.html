<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten up as essential. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as desired.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an essential part in an advanced system that has been created and crafted to take all of the floodwaters and run from rainstorms and channel it securely into the cities drainage systems. Without storm drains we 'd have to handle flooded areas frequently during bouts of serious rain.

<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no negative results and are, in fact, important daily nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing flavor lots of people find preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

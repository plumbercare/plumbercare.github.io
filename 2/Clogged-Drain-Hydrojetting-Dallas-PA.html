<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed effectively (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

It needs more than just effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the difficulty is often due to how problematic it is to examine the damage.

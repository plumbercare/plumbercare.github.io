<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the home, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>

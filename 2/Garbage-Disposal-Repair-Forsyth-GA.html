<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>

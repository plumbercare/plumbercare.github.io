<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your house. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a major issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a persistent sewage odor in your home, it is essential that you call a certified plumber. Raw sewage is extremely unsafe and can posture severe health threats.</p>
<p>A normal whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to five days, depending on the size of the house, the number of levels it has actually and the picked pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, entirely replace the pipes, reinstall the removed drywall and patch it to erase any signs of damage or change to your house.</p>

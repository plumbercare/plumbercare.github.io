<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items containing severe chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>On and off does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically identified before it causes any substantial damage. The water leak is normally the size of a pinhole. This small hole enables water to constantly leak out very gradually. With time it can lead to a substantial construct of water. Dripped water usually stays under the house and saturates into the ground soil. This can potentially trigger a cavity if the house's foundation was not properly compacted.

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Montevideo MN</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to express the strength of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Carbon dioxide will possibly contribute to the development of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>

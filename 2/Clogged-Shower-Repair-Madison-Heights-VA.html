<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Madison Heights VA 24572</h3>
<p>Water temperature issues can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can merely unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>

<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a private water supply exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause normal flow to reverse.

Preventive cleaning for drains need to be carried out on all drains, consisting of toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>

When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to notice gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or odd smells.

Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>

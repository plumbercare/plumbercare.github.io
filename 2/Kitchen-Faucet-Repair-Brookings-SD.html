<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping material throughout your home repiping task. Copper is basic because it's long-lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is difficult to install, which indicates greater labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which implies plumbers can flex the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which conserves time and money and lowers the danger of joint leaks. PEX also resists corrosion and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which product is best depending upon your requirements.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to solve the issue. Other times a more substantial service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Drain cleanouts offer an entry point into your house's drainage system so clogs can be eliminated. They are typically white pipes situated outside your home but can be other colors. Cleanouts enable easy access into your drain system so when you have an issue a technician can get the rooter machine into the line to clear the clog or camera the line.</p>

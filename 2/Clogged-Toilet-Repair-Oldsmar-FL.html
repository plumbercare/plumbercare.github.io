<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Oldsmar FL</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is very crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Current policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide 2 types of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

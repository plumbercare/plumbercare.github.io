<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger defense assembly.</p>

<p>Having another problem with your toilet? If so, you're probably questioning if it's going to need more than an easy repair this time-or perhaps even a brand-new toilet.

<p>Plumbing is an important part of your house or business, and its ability to function is important. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this could be a sign of a bigger problem, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog sometimes but you can generally flush them out, this might be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small clogs can become big ones relatively quickly.</p>

<p>Each element of the assembly must be checked to identify what needs repair. The field test may not constantly reveal you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair set are needed. There may be extra test procedures, beyond those established in the tester accreditation program, that can provide information revealing the severity of the failure that could assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Due to the fact that it is a large task that is often viewed as an unneeded cost, numerous homeowners avoid repiping their homes. Why repipe your home when repairing it is possible? Well, the truth is that repiping is more cost-effective and efficient in most cases. At Epic Plumbing, we offer house owners with personalized, cost-effective repiping options in Pearland and beyond.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there ought to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Your service provider will call when the installer is on the way, usually about an hour before the scheduled visit time. Upon arrival, a relied on professional will present their House Depot Provider badge, and perform the initial walkthrough to verify the scope of work. The installation can start as soon as you agree to move forward. This normally only takes a few hours, however if there are unexpected circumstances, your provider might need to return the following day.</p>

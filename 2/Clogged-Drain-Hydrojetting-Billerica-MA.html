You don't need to do a thing! We'll advise you when it's time for your yearly plumbing inspection. There is no easier method to keep your house's plumbing system operating at peak efficiency.</p>
<p>One common method for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private houses, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and contaminating the public water system.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

When these parts break, they result in small leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye.

Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Handheld sprayer. Leakages can sometimes develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are attached to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will drip into the cabinet underneath. A reduced pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it comes to backflow preventers, and is the device of option due to the fact that it can endure the introduction of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a wise choice for residential water supply.</p>

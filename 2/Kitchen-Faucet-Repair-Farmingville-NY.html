<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

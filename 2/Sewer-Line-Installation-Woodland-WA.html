For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or real connection in between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow impurities or contaminants to enter the drinkable water supply.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

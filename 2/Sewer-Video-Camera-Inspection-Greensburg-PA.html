Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

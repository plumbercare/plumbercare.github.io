<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

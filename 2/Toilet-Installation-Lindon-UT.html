<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair procedure, he should be sure he has actually evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any limiting conditions. Correct security preventative measures must be followed for proper entry if the area is thought about a restricted area. A appropriate and safe  workplace might require the placement of safety barricades or entry constraints around the work area so the repair technician or the general public around your workspace are not damaged. If the backflow preventer is set up in a limiting area, this might affect the technician's ability to effectively complete the repair.</p>

<p>We suggest that house owners purchase cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least as soon as per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running efficiently. It's also advantageous since, at the very same time, the plumber can anticipate the drains and recommend any drain repair, or drain cleaning company. Sometimes whatever is clogging the drain won't budge. It might be time to call a professional plumber if you have actually tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck.

<p>The average toilet will last for decades and have very little problems that can be easily repaired without replacement. However, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is essential to have a experienced and licensed  plumber handle the job. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than thirty years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a brand-new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a new home, or merely wanting to upgrade your present toilet, we guarantee that our installation procedure won't damage your home or its plumbing system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>

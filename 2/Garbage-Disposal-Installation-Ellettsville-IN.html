<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the service with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, usually sodium. Salt won't cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds only a very small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

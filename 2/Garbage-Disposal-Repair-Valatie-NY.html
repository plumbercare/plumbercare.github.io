Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

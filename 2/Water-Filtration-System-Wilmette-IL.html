<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible option, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>

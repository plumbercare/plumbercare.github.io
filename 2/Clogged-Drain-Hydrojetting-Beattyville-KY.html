When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If the leaking water heater is inside of the house, it is nest to instantly run the water off to the heater and schedule an appointment with a plumber to avoid flooding inside of the home. Before we start any work, Accurate Leak and Line will prepare a schematic diagram that will map out the damage and the work needed to replace the pipe and provide a price quote of the cost of the replacement.</p>

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>Quality sinks properly set up last for years, so we're generally hired for kitchen and bath remodels. But with discolorations or scratches in a kitchen sink as well as cracked or cracked porcelain in bathroom sinks many house owners choose a sink installation alone. Sinks and fixtures might also develop drain problems that require a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also include adjusting or changing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try dumping a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing group gets the job done quickly and affordably.</p>

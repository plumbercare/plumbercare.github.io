<p>Pipeline leak detection is utilized to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has taken place in systems which include gases and liquids. Applications range from softening in remote locations to addressing concerns of reagent addition. Motor sizes for garbage disposal are given in horse power, or HP. These correspond directly to how much waste the unit can manage, and recommended sizes are normally based upon how many users are in a household.

Installations should just be performed by plumbers as the installation needs both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>

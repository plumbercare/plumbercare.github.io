<p>No, you must NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be much more damaging than useful, possibly gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, including both water supply and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe is worth the financial investment in the long run due to the fact that it might attend to the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>

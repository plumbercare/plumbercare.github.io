<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule.</p>

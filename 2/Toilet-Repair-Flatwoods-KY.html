<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

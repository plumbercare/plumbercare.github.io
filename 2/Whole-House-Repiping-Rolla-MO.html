<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

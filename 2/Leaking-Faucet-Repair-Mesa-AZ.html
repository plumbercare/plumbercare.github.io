<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

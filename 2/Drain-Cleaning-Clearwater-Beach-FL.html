<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

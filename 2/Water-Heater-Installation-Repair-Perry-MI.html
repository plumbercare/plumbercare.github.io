<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Service in Perry</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to blockages that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>

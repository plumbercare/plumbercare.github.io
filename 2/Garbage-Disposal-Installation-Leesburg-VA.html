<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Quality sinks appropriately installed last for years, so we're usually hired for kitchen and bath remodels.

Fixtures and sinks might also develop drain problems that call for a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also include changing or replacing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>

<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex clinical procedure, however easy to fix. It utilizes salt to eliminate odors and minerals found in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>

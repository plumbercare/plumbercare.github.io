<p>Property owners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electrical unit is more cost-efficient. The response depends upon your home. While gas designs are less expensive to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electric water heater is normally lower, but it can be more expensive to run.

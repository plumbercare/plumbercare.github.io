<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic.

<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This deterioration can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

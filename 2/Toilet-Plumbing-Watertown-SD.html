<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are naturally more concerned about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any readily available source to accomplish their goal, however fire department cars often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>

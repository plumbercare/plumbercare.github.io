Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items consisting of severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>

The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>

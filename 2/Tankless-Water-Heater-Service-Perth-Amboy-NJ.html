As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another idea to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

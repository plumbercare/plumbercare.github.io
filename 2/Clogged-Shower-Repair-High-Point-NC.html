<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>If you observe low water pressure or tarnished water, it typically symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop over time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>

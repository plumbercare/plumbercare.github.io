<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

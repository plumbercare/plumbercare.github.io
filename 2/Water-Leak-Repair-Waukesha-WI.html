Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have talked to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

Even little leakages can slowly dampen walls and floors until they end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other allergens. Old galvanized iron pipes may become corroded and add rust to the supply of water. Gurgling noise from pipes. A weird, gurgling sound originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a good indication. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not be enough to resolve this problem. Call a plumber immediately.</p>

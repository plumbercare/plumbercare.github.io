<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>

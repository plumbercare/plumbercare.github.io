<p>The electric hot water heater is one of the most popular models chosen by consumers. Prior to making the decision to get an electrical heater, it is very important that you are familiar with more about this specific model and the advantages it needs to offer.

<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you might not desire just running outside. Not to mention plumbing code may be violated without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.

<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, but its high cost makes it not practical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in many cases, include phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>

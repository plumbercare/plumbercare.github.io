Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>

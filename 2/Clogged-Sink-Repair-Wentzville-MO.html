<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are naturally more concerned about drawing enough water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any offered source to attain their objective, but fire department automobiles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>

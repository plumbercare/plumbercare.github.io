The 2 kinds of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are two extremely different products, however they both have unbelievable toughness and longevity.</p>
<p>Puronics ® whole-house bacteriostatic water softener systems integrate SilverShield ® Security, which is based on NASA innovation, to hinder germs development within the filter media bed. Our bacteriostatic water softener systems also use the advanced technology of the iGen ® ... the valve so smart it does the thinking for you.

<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be assessed. The installation needs to be assessed to guarantee it does not circumvent the functions of the assembly. Test information must be collected to determine the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flowchart is required to ensure it was repaired appropriately. An appropriately fixed assembly needs to supply years of protection.</p>

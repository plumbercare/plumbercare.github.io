<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not properly secured, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is only equipped to manage softer organic waste. If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it could trigger it to jam and not work correctly. By running hot water through the disposal, you may have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
<p>It usually signifies rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or tarnished water.

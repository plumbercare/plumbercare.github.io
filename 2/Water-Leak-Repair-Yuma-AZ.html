<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

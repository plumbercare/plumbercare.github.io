<p>There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately two hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>

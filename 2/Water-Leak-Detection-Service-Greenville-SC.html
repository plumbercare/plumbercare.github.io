You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regrow the resin beads that take the firmness out of water.</p>
<p>Plumbers normally begin as apprentices. From there, they earn a journey and check plumbing license, and ultimately be granted a master plumbing license.

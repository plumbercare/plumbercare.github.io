<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high risk protection assembly.</p>

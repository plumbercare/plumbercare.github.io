For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>

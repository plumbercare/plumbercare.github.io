<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester.

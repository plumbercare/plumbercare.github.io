<p>Galvanized steel potable water system and distribution pipes are frequently discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and difficult to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

<h3>Drain Pipe Repair in Stafford Virginia</h2>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Common sufficient that lots of people choose do-it-yourself repairs. However in some cases even identifying the leak can be a problem. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, floorings, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain specialist to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to recognize and repair the drain issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically useful in finding an issue.</p>

<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 basic types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to run the unit. Constant feed is common and the most convenient to use; a batch feed model is much safer but can be slower to utilize on big amounts of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company provides an introduction of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>

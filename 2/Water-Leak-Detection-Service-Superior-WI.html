<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct kind of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see area listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly must fulfill the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be terminated up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can take place if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for residents. A PE or RA can help identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>

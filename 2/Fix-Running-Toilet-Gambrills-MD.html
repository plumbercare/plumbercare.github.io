<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for the majority of building contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

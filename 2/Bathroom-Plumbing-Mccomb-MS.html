<p>A kitchen sink repair is a typical problem in many residential homes. It is one of the most used plumbing fixture that with time if not taken care of could cause a huge problem at the owners expense. As seen on the above picture, there are numerous parts to a kitchen sink. A kitchen sink repair might be as simple as changing a shut off valve or as complicated as repairing the drain assembly to your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Hot water is no longer a high-end-- it's a need. In Kingman, people utilize hot water for whatever from doing the dishes to taking a relaxing shower, and even going one day without it presents a massive inconvenience. If you're having problems with your existing hot water heater-- or you need to get a new one-- don't attempt to deal with it alone.  Call Plumbing by Jake.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or irreversible connection between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check avoids backflow triggered by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing. While most plumbers expect payment on the day of service, or in a timely manner once they have sent an invoice, lots of plumbing contractors need that you pay a deposit upfront. A deposit of no more than half of the task quote is normally gathered beforehand and deducted from the total job cost when it is completed.</p>

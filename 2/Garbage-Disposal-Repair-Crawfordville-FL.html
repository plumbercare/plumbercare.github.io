Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.

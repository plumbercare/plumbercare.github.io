<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

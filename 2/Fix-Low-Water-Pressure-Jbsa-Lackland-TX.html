The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch moisture so that it does not go into the control system. Although little pieces of sediment might survive a drip leg.</p>

Garbage disposals can weigh 15 lbs. or more. That's a lot of weight to suddenly catch with one hand while you're turning the lower installing bracket with the other hand.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes.

You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Some customers like to have softer water and select to install a water softening system. Again, it's individual preference and completely up to the private customer. If you see any of these signs to have a Rainaldi plumbing professional check your water lines or pipes before its too late, contact us right away. Our check-up, integrated with a preventive maintenance schedule, will guarantee your plumbing and drainage systems are working appropriately.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot.

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

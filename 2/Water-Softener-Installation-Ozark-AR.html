<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis.

Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

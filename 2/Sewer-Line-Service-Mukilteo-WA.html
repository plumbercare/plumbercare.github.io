<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

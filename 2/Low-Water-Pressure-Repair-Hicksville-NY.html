Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc.

Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation.

As soon as the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

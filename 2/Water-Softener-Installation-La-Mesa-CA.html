<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause substantial problems. Even little leakages can gradually dampen walls and floorings until they end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may end up being corroded and include rust to the water supply. Gurgling sound from pipes. A strange, gurgling sound originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never an excellent sign. Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to address this issue. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
<p>This is incredibly crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system.

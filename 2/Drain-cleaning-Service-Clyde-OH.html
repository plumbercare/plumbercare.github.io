<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>

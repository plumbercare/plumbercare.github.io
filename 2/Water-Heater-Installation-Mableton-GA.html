<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

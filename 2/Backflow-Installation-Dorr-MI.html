<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and duty are exceptionally crucial to building a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water supply within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their regular usage. When these parts wear, they lead to small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>

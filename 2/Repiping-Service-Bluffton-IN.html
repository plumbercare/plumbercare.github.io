<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals.

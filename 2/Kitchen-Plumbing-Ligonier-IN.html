<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Remove the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten up as required. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as desired.</p>
<p>Drains clog for a factor, but it's not constantly obvious. It is highly suggested that a professional plumber carry out a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has actually clogged. If you're purchasing a house, this is doubly important. Think of in the above situation knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a home. You can't always be specific whether the house has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous homeowner understood the reason for the clog A simple camera inspection might make you aware of a very pricey and covert issue prior to the purchase.</p>

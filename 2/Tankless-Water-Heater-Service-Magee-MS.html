<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>

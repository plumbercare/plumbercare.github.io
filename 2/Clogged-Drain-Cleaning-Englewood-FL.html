<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>The heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this specific concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your house. The factors for this can vary from leakages, faulty or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is among the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the elements may be sufficient. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems occurring regularly, then a water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Lots of scattering systems currently have the appropriate backflow preventer set up and need just be tested yearly.

Additionally, if you notice increasing energy bills from an inefficient system, you will also save money with a new installation. We recommend that all water heaters that are 10-15 years old be changed in order to conserve the homeowner time and money in the future.</p>

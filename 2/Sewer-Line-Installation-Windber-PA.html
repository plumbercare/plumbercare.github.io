<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

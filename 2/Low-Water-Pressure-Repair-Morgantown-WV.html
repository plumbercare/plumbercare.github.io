Like any home device, a toilet tank features many little moving parts that might need changed with use with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

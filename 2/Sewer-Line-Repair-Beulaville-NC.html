<h3>Drain Clean Out in Beulaville North Carolina</h2>
<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>

Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

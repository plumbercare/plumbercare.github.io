<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered extremely low salt" by the Fda.</p>

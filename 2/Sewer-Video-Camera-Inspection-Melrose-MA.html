The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly need to be tested to determine what requires repair. The field test might not constantly show you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are necessary. There may be extra test procedures, beyond those developed in the tester certification program, that can supply data revealing the severity of the failure that might help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>

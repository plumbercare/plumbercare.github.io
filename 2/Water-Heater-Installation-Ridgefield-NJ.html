<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

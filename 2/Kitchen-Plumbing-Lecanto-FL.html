<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing set up throughout building and construction of a brand-new or refurbished building is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a component can cause harmful damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>

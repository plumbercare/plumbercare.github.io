<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

Though it might need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through.

Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly secured, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a drinkable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one instructions.

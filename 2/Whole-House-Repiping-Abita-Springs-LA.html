Our equipment is trenchless-based, and the liner we insert into the sewer line is able to inflate in order to apply the epoxy resin.

Expected to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are developed to be effective and resilient, withstanding corrosion and other typical problems that can plague other pipeline material types.</p>

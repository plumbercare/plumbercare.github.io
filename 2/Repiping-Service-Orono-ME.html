<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To prevent this, make certain the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>

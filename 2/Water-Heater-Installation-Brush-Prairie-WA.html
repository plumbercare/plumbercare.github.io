<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process.

Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>Backflow is a prospective problem in a water supply due to the fact that it can spread out contaminated water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or prospective connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit impurities or toxins to get in the potable water system. Sickness can arise from ingesting water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>

Due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates, firmness can appear as a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip.

<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain service technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically beneficial in finding an issue.</p>

<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical enough that many individuals go for do-it-yourself repairs. But in some cases even determining the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

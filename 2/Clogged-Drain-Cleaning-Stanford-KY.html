<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when utilized in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with protecting people's lives and to a lesser degree their residential or commercial property. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source readily available to accomplish that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome indicate that the level of defense on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's generally not smart to pay for repairs if they are worth more than half of the price of a new system.

A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>

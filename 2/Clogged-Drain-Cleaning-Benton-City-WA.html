<p>Garbage disposal clogged or broken? Whether you need repairs or replacement, we've got you covered in the Cincinnati area. Garbage disposals are designed to work in one of two ways. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is switched on, or through a continuous feed, where the system can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>Jams-- The disposal may become jammed with food or other items. We can clear jams and assist clients know what they need to not put down their disposals.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>

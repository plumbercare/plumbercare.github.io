<p>Service Plumbing and Heating offers quality commercial and residential plumbing and heating services to Seattle, Shoreline, Lynnwood, Bellevue, Kirkland and surrounding areas. Anti-siphon valves must never be installed below ground, even if buried in a box. Gas Line Installation, Repair, and Maintenance. 1. DO use plenty of water each time you grind up food residue, and keep water running for a couple of seconds after the disposal is done. When you're ready to really install your garbage disposal, follow these actions listed below thanks to Lowe's project professional, Hunter Macfarlane. As you review these actions, if anything offers you stop briefly, feel free to hire a pro. There's no embarassment in getting a little assistance when you need it.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.

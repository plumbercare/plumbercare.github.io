<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer.

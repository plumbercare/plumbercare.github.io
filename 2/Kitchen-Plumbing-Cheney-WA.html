<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another tip to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

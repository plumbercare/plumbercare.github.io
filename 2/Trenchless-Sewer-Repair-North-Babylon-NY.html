<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the firmness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.

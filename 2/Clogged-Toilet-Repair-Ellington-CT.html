<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than items containing harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a garbage disposal is only equipped to handle softer natural waste. If bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal, it could trigger it to jam and not work properly. By running warm water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>There are two types of products utilized to construct a waste disposal unit system: aluminum and stainless-steel. The typical cost of an aluminum garbage disposal varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel waste disposal unit has an average cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously tough to trace, specifically on older properties, so you'll wish to employ someone who will trace the issue at its root cause.</p>

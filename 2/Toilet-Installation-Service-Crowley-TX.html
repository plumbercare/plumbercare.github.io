<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.

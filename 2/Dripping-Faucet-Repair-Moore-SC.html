<p>Waste disposal unit units may cost more when they have to fit local water and sewer capabilities. The plumbing in your house must work well or backup can occur, and septic systems might need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>

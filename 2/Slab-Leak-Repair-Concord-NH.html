<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>On and off does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically found before it triggers any considerable damage.

<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working effectively due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use more and more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

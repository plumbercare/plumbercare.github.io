<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would typically cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being broken and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater really quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>

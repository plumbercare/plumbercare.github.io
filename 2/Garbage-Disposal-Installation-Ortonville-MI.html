<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Ortonville MI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely rare cases where the building is deemed to not present a threat to the water supply, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

New meters must satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas companies may need a special meter for their services, limiting your choices.

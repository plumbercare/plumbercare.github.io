<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>

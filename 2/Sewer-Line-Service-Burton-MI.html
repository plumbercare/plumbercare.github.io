<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really important part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

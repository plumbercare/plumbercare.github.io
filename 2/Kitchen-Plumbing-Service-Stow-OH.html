<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid usually will help remove them. If you wish to try the gentlest method perhaps try using some Coke on the rust initially.

Wipe with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety cautions first!), if that does not do the technique.

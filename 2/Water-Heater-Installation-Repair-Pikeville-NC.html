<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Pikeville NC</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually salt. Salt won't trigger lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes just an extremely percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered really low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

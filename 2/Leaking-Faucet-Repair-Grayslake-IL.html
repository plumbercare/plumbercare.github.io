<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Grayslake IL</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction. In this post we look at plumbers vs. plumbing contractors and specialized plumbers. RPZ backflow systems, on the other hand, have valves that just open when water is streaming forward.</p>

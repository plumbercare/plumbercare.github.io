Some electrical knowledge is required to guarantee the wires are disconnected correctly. Answer: No! They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic style of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static circulation condition may cause problem dripping and prospective fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>

<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need.

It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>

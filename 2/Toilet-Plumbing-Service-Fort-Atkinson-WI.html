<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

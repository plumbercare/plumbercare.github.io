<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>

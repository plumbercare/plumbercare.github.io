<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Annandale VA</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly maintained. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>

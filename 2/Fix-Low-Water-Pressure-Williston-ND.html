It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>

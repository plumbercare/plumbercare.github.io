<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regeneration. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

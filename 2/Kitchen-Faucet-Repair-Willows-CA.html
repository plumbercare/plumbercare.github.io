<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger significant problems. Even little leaks can gradually dampen walls and floorings until they end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes may become corroded and include rust to the water system. Gurgling sound from pipes. An unusual, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever an excellent sign. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to resolve this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house.

Call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing inspected and we will let you know if a repipe in Brenham is right for you.</p>

<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Woodbine MD</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically salt. Sodium won't trigger lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a very small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered extremely low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

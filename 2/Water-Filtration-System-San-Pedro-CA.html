The demand upstream might cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Rockville Centre NY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not posture a risk to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

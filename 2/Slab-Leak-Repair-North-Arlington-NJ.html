<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly.

You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak.

We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

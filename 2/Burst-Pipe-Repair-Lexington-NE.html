<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Service in Lexington</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates specialist inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.

The details we glean from the inspection permits us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the very best option also.

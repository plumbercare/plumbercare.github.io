<h3>Tips For Finding An Emergency Plumber Opa Locka FL</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>

<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

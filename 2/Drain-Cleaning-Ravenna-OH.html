<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger security assembly.</p>

<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Among the things we focus on is the bathroom toilet. So many people and businesses let the toilet drainage year after year with leaking or ineffective models. This is cash and a natural deposit running down the drain. Water conservation in the desert is very important and older toilets can use 3.5 gallons of water per flush! Our master technicians will be able to restore or replace the toilet the very same day for the most part conserving you time and money.</p>

In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>

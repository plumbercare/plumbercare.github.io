<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.

Backflow can occur in a variety of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines.

<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners wish to get their hands dirty with.

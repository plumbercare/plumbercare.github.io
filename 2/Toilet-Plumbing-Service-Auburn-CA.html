<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>

When your plumber has installed a gas line, you'll want an audit of the plumbing and installation to make sure that there are no gas leakages. This ought to be done before the plumber leaves the job. The audit will lessen the chances of a gas leak. If you do observe a pungent odor in your home after your plumber leaves, turned off the gas valves right away.

<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures if using one of these items.</p>

<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. First, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to authorize and process. Turned down plans need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>

<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Gas companies normally do not charge for the preliminary visit as their concern is to stop any gas leakages or problems. If you have a little leak, your gas costs may be greater than normal.

Water conditioners are low maintenance, you don't need to include chemicals or salt.</p>

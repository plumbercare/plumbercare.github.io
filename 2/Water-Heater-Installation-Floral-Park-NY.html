A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part.

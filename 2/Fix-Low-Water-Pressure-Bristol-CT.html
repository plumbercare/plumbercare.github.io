<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>

It is very challenging to evaluate such claims, which are practically never based on tests that are well enough described to allow others to examine them and to verify the results.

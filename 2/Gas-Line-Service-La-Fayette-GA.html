Drains can become blocked over time, but the consequences happen quickly and without caution.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use a growing number of cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>

Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection between a public water supply or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

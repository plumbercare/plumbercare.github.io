<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a substandard plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger security assembly.</p>

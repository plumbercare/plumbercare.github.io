<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Gas companies typically do not charge for the preliminary visit as their top priority is to stop any gas leakages or problems. Your gas costs may be higher than normal if you have a small leak.

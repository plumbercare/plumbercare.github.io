Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a much better choice. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, total sewer excavation can cause a lot of civilian casualties (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>

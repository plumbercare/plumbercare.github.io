<p>If your assembly stops working the annual test, you are accountable for repairing or changing the assembly within 1 month. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see area below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly should satisfy the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be discontinued up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline.

<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the three readily available techniques. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and require fewer repairs over time.

When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>

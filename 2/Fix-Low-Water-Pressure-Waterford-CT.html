<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist fight a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

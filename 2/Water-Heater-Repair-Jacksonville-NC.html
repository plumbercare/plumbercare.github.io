<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer decades of protection. There are many local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature can all cause the assembly to deteriorate in its efficiency.

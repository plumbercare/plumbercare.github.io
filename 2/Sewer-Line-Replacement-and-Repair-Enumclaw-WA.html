<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed throughout construction of a new or renovated structure is installed by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes.

I 'd like to publish some images of this. Just search line. The problem does exist.</p>

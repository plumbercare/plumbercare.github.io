Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system.

Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>

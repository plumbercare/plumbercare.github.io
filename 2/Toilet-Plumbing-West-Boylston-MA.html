The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

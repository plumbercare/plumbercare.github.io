The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment market, has actually not had the ability to determine standards for these products and report irregular efficiency to date. Research has actually shown no change happens in the chemical and physical residential or commercial properties or the calcium ion concentration of water treated with the gadgets (The Water Quality Association Magnetics Job Force, 2001).</p>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and responsibility are incredibly important to developing a track record for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Except for domestic pump and pump and irrigation systems, certification is not required to install plumbing systems outside of a structure (e.g., water lines linked straight to community water pipe, sewer line connections, and so on).

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

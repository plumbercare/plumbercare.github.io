<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an important part in an advanced system that has been created and engineered to take all of the floodwaters and run from rainstorms and channel it securely into the cities drainage systems. Without storm drains we 'd need to deal with flooded areas often throughout bouts of extreme rain.

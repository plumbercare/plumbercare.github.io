<h3>Quality Plumbing Service East Elmhurst NY</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>When handled early, all of these problems are common and easy to deal with. By calling Bell Cow at (844) 234-2355 upon first noticing an issue, you can prevent more serious problems brought on by leaks, like structural damage. Don't get milked by your water costs either! A properly-repaired sink, faucet, or bathtub will remove leaks and cut back on water waste.</p>

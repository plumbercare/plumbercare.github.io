<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>

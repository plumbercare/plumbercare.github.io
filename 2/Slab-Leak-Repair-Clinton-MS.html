<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program protects the public water supply from contaminants and impurities that could, under certain situations, be drawn into the public water system from private properties. The cost mainly depends on the toilet you select if you need a brand-new toilet. Toilets vary in style, flushing effectiveness and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more expensive than others. When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>

<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

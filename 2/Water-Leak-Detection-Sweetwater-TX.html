<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Sweetwater TX 79556</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>

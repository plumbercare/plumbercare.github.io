<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's concealed; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floorings, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>

<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a blockage. The other is to go ahead and replace the whole line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable alternative to do just that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>

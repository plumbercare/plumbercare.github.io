<p>While combating a fire, firemens are naturally more worried about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to accomplish their objective, but fire department automobiles frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

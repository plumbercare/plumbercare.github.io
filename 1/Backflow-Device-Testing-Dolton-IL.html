<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

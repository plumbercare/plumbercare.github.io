<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller sized model that operated on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains.

It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big industrial and municipal sewer pipes.

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are included into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking.

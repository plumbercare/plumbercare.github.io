Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

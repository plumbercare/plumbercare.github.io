<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage.

<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

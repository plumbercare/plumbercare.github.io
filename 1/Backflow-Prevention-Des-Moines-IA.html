<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

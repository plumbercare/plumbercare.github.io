Some property owners will try to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are dealing with a small drain clog. Nevertheless, they are normally temporary fixes that do not offer long-term resolutions.</p>

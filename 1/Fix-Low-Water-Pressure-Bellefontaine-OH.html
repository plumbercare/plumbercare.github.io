<p>Unless you have a clever two-year old who likes to throw toilet tissue down the toilet, you should not have regular clogging issues. In reality, you ought to seldom have a clogged toilet if you are utilizing it correctly and if it is functioning properly. If you are having a toilet that clogs continuously and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing regularly, then it's most likely time for a new toilet. This may be an indication that your toilet has a malfunctioning part or there is a various blockage in your sewer lines. In either case, you need to call us for a house plumbing inspection immediately.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Purchasing a home is a big investment.

Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the suitable precautions if utilizing among these items.</p>

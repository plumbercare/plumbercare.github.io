<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

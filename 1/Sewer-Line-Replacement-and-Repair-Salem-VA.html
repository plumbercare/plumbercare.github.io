<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

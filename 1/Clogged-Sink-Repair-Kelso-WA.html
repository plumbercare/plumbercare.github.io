<p>E.R. Services understands the value of keeping the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Running out of warm water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Copper is the industry requirement due to the fact that it is long lasting and resilient. We will offer you various options based upon your budget and preferences. PEX piping is a new option that is flexible, resistant to corrosion, and up to 75 percent less expensive than copper piping.</p>

<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

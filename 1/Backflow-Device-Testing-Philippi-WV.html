<p>Don't put everything down your waste disposal unit. It's important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause jams and blockages - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain as well. After completing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside.

<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and obligation are exceptionally important to developing a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water supply within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly need to be checked to identify what is in need of repair. The field test may not constantly reveal you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair kit are essential. There may be additional test procedures, beyond those established in the tester accreditation program, that can offer data revealing the severity of the failure that could assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>

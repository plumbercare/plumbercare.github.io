<h3>Broken Toilet in Moscow Idaho</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>

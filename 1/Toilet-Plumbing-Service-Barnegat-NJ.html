<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>

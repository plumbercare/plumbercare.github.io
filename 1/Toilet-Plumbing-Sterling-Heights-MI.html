<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>

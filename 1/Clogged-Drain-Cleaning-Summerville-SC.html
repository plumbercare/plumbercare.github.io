<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.

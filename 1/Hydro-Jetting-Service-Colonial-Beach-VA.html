It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>

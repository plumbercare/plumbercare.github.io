<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>

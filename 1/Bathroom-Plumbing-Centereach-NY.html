<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

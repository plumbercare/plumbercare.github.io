<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.

This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

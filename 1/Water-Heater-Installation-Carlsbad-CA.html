<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>

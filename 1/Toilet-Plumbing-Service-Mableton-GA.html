<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Geneva NY 14456</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with tough water, you might not understand how much it affects you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>

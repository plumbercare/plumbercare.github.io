<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with hard water, you might not realize just how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Hard water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>

Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably pricey, and difficult to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements usually discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades.

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

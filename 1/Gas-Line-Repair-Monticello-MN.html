<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous.

Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

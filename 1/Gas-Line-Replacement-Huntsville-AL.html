I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Pell City AL</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is because there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and quite low-cost to install, so there's no factor not to. Ultimately causing a backup when grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and avoids water circulation. This included with other debris in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>

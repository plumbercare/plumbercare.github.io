<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

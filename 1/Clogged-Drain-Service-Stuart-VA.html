<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.

A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

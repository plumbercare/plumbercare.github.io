<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult job due to the fact that of the age of your house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left.

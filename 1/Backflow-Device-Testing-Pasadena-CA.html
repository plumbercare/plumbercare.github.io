<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use a growing number of detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option.

Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

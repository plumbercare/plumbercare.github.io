<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes.

The high-resolution light offers a clear image for the technician to accurately take a look at conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The information we obtain from the inspection enables us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the best option as well. If the pipe requires to be cleaned of clogs or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal suggestion with confidence.</p>

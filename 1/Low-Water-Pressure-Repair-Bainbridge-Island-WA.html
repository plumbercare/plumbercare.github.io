<p>If you notice low water pressure or blemished water, it generally signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>

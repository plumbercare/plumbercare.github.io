<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>

I have actually been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

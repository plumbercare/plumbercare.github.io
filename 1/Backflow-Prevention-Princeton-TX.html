<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

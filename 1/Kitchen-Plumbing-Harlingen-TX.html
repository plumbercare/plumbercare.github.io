Methane is a naturally taking place gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer.

It is rarely used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

A deposit of no greater than half of the task price quote is generally gathered in advance and deducted from the overall project cost when it is finished.</p>

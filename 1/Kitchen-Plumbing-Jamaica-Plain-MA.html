It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage should also be supplied.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to conduct site inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a potential or real cross-connection threat on a customer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only performed on Wednesdays. Spot Repairs: Using one or a combination of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection straight without uprooting anymore than we need to.</p>

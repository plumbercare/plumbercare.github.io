<p>Hydro jetting is among numerous trenchless services readily available to you, accessible through North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is making use of hot, highly pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all blockages.

It also conserves you cash and time because a 2nd inspection isn't necessary.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices.

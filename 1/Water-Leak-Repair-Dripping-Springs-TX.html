Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining pipes fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>

In addition, grease and oil can cake and gather in your drain also. After completing cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve.

Regular hot water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and help avoid unexpected leakages or other problems.

<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently since tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

To avoid this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>These problems can be taken care of except for cracks in the body or interior lining of the disposal. If this is your problem, you will need to install a new garbage disposal.

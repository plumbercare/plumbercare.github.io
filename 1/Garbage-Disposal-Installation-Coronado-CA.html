<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electrical water heaters and tankless hot water heater. Gently flex the float arm down to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To adjust a float that does not have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, broken flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the professionals at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and reduce lost water.</p>

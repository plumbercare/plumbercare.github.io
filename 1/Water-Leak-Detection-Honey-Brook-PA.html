<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the main and very first questions that you ought to ask yourself. The age of your house is a vital element to understand whether or not you need to repipe your house.

Opportunities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at ideal rates if your house was built years prior to that.</p>

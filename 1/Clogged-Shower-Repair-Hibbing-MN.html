<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical life expectancy calculation assumes typical wear and tear of the unit. The lifespan of a waste disposal unit may be lower in the case of overlook, overuse, and abuse of the disposal unit. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation?

<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>

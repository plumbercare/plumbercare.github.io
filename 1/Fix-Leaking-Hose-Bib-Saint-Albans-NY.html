<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

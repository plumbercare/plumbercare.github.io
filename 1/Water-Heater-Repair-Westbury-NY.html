Exemptions, which are granted in extremely unusual cases where the structure is considered to not pose a danger to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

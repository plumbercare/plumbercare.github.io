<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

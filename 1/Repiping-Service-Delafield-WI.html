<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see however hardly ever stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

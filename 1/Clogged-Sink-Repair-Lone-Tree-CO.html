<p>Provided there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial hot water heater can be fixed, but is it worth repairing? Just after answering the following concerns must you respond to repair or replace. Do you know how many years old your hot water heater is? Do you know how many years it's rated for? Think about replacement instead of repair if it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix.

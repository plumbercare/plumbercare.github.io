Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that certain magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be effective in avoiding scale formation in tough water supply. It is very hard to evaluate such claims, which are practically never based upon tests that are well sufficient explained to permit others to assess them and to confirm the results.

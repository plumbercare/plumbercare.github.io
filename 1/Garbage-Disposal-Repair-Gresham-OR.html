The plumbing professional can advise what type of sink would fit best.</p>
<p>If you see absolutely nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist ideal and left. If the motor spins freely, check that the breaker hasn't tripped and then attempt the reset button. If these measures don't work, and your disposer's service warranty has expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>Your water heater. The pro will next examine your hot water heater.

For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

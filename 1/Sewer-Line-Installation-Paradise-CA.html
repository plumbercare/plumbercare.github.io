<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

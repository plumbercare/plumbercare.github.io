Look for leakages under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten up as necessary. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as wanted.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow.

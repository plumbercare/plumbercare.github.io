<p>You are responsible for fixing or replacing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly stops working the annual test. All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate type of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly needs to meet the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated till the assembly is in compliance.</p>

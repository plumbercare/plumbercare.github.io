<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

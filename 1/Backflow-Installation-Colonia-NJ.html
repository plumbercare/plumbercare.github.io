<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Colonia NJ</h3>

A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a danger to the supply of water, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

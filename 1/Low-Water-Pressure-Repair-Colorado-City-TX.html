However, the majority of toilet repairs are simple and uncomplicated tasks - such as replacing a used flapper - that most people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roofing vents or take out a toilet. This is generally more labor-intensive and may require additional expenses. Since the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the blockage, this is also not as efficient.

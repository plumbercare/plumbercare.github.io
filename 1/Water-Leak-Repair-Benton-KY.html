<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller model that operated on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

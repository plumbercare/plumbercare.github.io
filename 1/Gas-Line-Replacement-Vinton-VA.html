<p>Everybody who's installed a few disposals understands this mistake: Forgetting to get rid of the dishwasher knockout before hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the issue might be larger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal correctly, creating waste and a greater water bill.</p>

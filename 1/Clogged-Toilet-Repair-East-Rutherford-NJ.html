<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

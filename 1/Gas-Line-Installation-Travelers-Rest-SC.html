Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or surpass the state requirements and bring the duty for implementing them.</p>

A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in individual houses, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and contaminating the general public water system.</p>

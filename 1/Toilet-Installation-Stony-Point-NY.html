<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>

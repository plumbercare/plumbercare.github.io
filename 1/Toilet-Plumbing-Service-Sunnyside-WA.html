<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more vulnerable and breakable to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are prone to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and pressures as an outcome of temperature level change and ice development. And these differences dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>

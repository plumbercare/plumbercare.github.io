<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

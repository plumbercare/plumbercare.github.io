<p>Aiming to repair or replace your garbage disposal?

This is especially so if the overall cost of the task goes beyond or is $500.</p>
<p>High water pressure also harms plumbing. The water entering the house puts excess pressure on faucet seal, water shut down valves and supply lines, and toilets. High water pressure results in leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to occur without proper pressure decrease. You can also save on salt, water, and energy by using up to 50% less detergent for laundry and dishwashing, using up to 34% less salt and approximately 35% less water during regeneration.</p>

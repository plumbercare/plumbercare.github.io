I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.

<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>

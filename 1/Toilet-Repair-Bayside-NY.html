Sanford & Son plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid generally will help eliminate them. If you want to attempt the gentlest approach possibly try using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and safety cautions initially!), if that doesn't do the technique.

Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I examined around. Under the sink, place a pail or pan beneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>

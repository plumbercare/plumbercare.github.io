<p>It's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a brand-new one if your hot water tank is over 15 years old. Switch on the shower in the room farthest from the house's water source. Inspect the temperature level of the water and the water pressure. Garbage disposals also need regular use to avoid malfunction. Who you employ will also determine just how much you'll pay for a new waste disposal unit installation.</p>

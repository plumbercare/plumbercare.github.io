(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>

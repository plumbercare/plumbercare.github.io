<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Castleton On Hudson NY</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>

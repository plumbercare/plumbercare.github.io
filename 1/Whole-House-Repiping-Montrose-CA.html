<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Montrose CA 91020!</h3>
<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared cleaning agent dose, water solidity, and washing temperature to see if hardness had an effect on detergent savings. The study included tests that removed challenging soils, in addition to evaluating identifying and filming. Scientists discovered that softened water uses almost 30% less detergent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this method uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are become a stable crystalline kind that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and circulation usually through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regrowth.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

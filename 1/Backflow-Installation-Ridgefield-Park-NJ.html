<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Ridgefield Park NJ</h3>
<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water supply. The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.

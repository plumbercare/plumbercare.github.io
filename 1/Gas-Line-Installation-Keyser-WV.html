<p>The most reliable method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

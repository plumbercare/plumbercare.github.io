<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable option, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>

<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Bacliff TX</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Was your home constructed prior to the 1970s and has not undergone improvement or pipe replacement?

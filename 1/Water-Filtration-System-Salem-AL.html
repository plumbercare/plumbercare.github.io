When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to stream backwards into city water products.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is an excellent alternative for many people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the process of replacing old rusty pipes with lasting and durable new pipes.

Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>

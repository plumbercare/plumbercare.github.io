<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly.

A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<h3>Water Softener Repair in Lewiston Maine</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

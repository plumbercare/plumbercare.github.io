Difficult water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>

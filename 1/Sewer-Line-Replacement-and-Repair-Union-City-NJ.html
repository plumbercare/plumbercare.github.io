<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Union City NJ</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. A backflow takes place when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water supply. The water streaming in reverse from a cross-connection may pollute the drinking water supply. Lawn irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs prevail cross-connection points.

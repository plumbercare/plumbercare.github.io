<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>

For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful investment for your house.</p>

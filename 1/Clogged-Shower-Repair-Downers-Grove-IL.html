<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
<p>Were you to ask most people what word initially springs to mind when they consider a plumbing system, pipe" would undoubtedly be near the top of the list.

<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Marion KY</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not present a threat to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Monument CO</h3>
<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety precaution, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell typically related to rotten eggs. This unique aroma allows you to smell a prospective leak if it happens. If you think a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.

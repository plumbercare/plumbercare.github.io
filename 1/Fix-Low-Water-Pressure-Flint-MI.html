<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Flint Michigan</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your new disposal.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Most of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for security and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>

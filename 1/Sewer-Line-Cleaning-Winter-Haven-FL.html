<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Winter Haven</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it typically catches corrosion after about 50 years and needs replacement. Much more contemporary pipes will not last permanently, so keep an eye on plumbing systems that could be reaching the end of their life-span.</p>

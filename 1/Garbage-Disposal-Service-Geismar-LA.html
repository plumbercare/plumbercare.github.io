Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable supply of water within a structure these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC.

The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

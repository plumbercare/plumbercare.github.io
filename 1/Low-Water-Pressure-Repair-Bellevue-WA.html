<p>Depending on your situation, your plumber might utilize one or a mix of piping material during your home repiping project. Copper is basic due to the fact that it's lasting, can survive fires, and resists weather. Nevertheless, copper is challenging to install, which means greater labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which suggests plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves money and time and minimizes the risk of joint leaks. PEX also resists rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will choose which material is best depending upon your requirements.</p>

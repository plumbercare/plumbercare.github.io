<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.

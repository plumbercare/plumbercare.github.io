<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively because tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize more and more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>

And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away.

<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>

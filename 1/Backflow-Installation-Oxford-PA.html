<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly basic system, regardless of their significance. Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the watering line within your organisation, where watering meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems remains disconnected from clean" water.</p>

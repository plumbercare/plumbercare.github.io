Sediment Accumulation: If you discover odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating aspect. Running out of warm water rapidly is another indication of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification.

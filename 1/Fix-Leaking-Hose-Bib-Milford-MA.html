<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

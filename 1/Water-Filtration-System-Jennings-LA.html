<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>

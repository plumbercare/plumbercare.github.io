Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>

<p>Leaks - Next, leaks represent the most common cause for kitchen sink repair. Normally, they begin little and go undetected, and after time can lead to large puddles underneath your sink and kitchen cabinetry. This type results in possible water damage.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>

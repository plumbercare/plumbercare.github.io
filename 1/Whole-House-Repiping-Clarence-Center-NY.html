<p>I have actually been impressed with your company and its individuals from the day your sales person strolled in here, through all service personel, and now. By the way, this is a great system.

The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be bothersome. The twist-and-drop style is much easier to utilize but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>

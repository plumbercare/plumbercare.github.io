<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Depending on your water quality, some softeners may be able to totally or partially remove copper, manganese, radium, and iron, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Keep in mind that copper can reenter the water after if passes and leaves the softener through your home's pipes and plumbing. These softeners might have special filter media and may cost more than common softeners. Prior to utilizing a softener for this purpose, follow the suggestions noted in the house Water Treatment.</p>

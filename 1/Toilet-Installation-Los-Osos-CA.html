<h3>Clogged Drain in Los Osos California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

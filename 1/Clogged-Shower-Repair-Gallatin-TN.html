<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>

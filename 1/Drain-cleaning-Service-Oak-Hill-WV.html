<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping.

I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

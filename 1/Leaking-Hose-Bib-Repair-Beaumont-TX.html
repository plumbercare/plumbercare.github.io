<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, specifically when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>

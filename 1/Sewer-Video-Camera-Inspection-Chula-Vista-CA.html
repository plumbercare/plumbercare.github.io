<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Chula Vista CA 91911</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items containing harsh chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

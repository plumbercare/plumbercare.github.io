<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Walnut Creek CA</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

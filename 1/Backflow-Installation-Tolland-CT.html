You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.

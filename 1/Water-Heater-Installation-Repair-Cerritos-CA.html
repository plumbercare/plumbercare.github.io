<p>Plumbers typically start out as apprentices. From there, they make a journey and test plumbing license, and ultimately be awarded a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is often ground zero for clogs. As hair integrates with soap, it can develop the perfect storm for plumbing obstructions. Over time, these obstructions can intensify and prevent your bathtub from draining at all.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>

<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service DFW Plumbing Service Euclid OH</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You hear water running or leaking in the tank. When water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow occurs. The water streaming in reverse from a cross-connection may pollute the drinking water system. Lawn watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.

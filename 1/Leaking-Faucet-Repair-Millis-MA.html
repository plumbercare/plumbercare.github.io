<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Millis MA 02054</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing annual forward circulation tests are often viewed as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>

Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List to test the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the results to us. Be sure to discover a plumber you trust who will get the task done right at a reasonable cost if you need a garbage disposal replacement.</p>

Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

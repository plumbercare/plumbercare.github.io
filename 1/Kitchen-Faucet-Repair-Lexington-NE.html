<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Lexington NE</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>

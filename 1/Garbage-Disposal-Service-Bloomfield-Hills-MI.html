I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>

<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly.

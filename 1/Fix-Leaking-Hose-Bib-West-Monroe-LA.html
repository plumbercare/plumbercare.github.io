<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup might still occur.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>

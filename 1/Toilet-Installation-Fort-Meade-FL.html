<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

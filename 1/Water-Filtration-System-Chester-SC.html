<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades.

This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>

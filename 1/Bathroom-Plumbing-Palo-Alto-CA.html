When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>If you see nothing obvious, insert the wrench into the motor spline, discovered at the bottom of the unit, and twist best and left.

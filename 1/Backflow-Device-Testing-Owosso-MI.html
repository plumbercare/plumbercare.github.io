<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>

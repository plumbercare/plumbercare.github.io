<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

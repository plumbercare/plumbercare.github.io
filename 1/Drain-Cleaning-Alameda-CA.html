<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

If all of your Do It Yourself efforts do not work, stoppages in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets might be covered by an American Home Guard plumbing guarantee depending on the cause.

<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes frequently make weird gurgling noises as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the unusual sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't doing a total kitchen remodel, lots of people change out their kitchen sinks due to the fact that their old one is stained, broke, or otherwise damaged; or since they just want a new kitchen sink configuration with more depth, two sections, or a different shape. We will help you prevent the risks of inaccurate sink installation, guaranteeing that your new sink suits the spot you have, all pipes are functional, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works terrific.</p>

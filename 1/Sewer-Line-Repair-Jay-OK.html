Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

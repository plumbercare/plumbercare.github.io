<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't require fixing the entire toilet.

Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>

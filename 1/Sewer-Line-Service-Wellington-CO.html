<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. The pipes often make strange gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight area.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

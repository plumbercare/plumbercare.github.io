<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide.

If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>

As rust and minerals develop in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure.

Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>

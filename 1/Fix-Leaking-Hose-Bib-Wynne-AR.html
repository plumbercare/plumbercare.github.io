<p>There are a variety of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever. It has been in place because your house was constructed so it is about the very same age as your house. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your home.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>

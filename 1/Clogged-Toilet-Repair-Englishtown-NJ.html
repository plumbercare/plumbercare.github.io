<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair service technician knows the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

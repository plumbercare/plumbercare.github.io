<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Mecca CA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely unusual cases where the structure is considered to not position a danger to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>

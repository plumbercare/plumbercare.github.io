<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with difficult water, you might not understand how much it affects you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Tough water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>

<h3>Frozen Pips in Butner North Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>

To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to rinse out any buildup.</p>

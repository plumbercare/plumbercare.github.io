<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that of the intrinsic style of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or static flow condition might cause annoyance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>

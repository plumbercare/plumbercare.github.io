All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly must fulfill the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be terminated up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>

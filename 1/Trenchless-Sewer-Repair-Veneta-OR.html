<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both inside your home and underground, DCVs are a little bit more pricey however are also extremely convenient, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic systems or checking the condition of buried pipes to determine proper maintenance schedules or the extent of required repairs.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>

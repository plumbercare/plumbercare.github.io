<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth understanding about garbage disposal installation.

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in waste disposal unit installation make the job possibly dangerous. That makes it a terrific reason to employ a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Property owners can either purchase the new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and circulation pipes are frequently discovered with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever used today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building regulations non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also very durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly utilized pipe material for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be fixed by changing that section of harmed piping. However, when the issue is found in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to consider whole-house repiping. Few homeowners are delighted with the idea of replacing all their pipes, however handling the job prior to the plumbing system fails allows you to avoid considerable residential or commercial property damage.</p>

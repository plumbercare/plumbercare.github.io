Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw.

Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>

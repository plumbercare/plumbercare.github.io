Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products containing harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>

From there we can make a notified choice on whether your issue can be fixed by a basic repair or if changing the waste disposal unit is eventually the better option.</p>

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

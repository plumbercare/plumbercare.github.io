Difficult water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Difficult water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>

He noted that there are certain pollutants that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils which too can be corrected with the right RO system.</p>

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

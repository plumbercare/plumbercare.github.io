<p>You depend on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them tough to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its life expectancy, especially if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>At Air, Plumbing & Heating Solutions, we'll install a garbage disposal in your kitchen sink. We'll handle the entire installation from start to finish-- from switching off electrical power to eliminating and modifying drain lines, you can trust us to install a garbage disposal in your sink.

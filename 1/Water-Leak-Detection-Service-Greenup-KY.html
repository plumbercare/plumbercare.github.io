<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>

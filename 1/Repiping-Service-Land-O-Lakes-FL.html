<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>

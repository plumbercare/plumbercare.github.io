<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

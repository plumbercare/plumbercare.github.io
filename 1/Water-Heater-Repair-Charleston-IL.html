For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>

Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a possible issue with the water heater. It can also imply the hot water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years of ages. With heavy rust buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could indicate that there have been changes in pressure triggering small leaks.</p>

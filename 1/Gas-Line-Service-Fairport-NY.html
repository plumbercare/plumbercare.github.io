<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Fairport</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You may be lured to bond or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve money. While this may work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your house, suggesting that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid bigger leaks down the road.</p>

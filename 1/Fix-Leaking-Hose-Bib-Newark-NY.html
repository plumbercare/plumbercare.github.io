<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you should initially obtain the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Authorization page to find out more on obtaining an authorization. Once you obtain a license you can begin with the work. However, you should call for inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>

It may be typical to have condensation on warm water pipes, however it's definitely not typical for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

As piping installation and repair professionals, we can fix problems or point out when it will be more secure or more affordable to simply renovate your piping system.

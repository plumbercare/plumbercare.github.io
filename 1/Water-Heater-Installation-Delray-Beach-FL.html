<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is needed to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Checking the age, water, and condition lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand lots of things, including water pressure and indications of leakages. It can likely last beyond its standard warranty if the water heater has been kept with annual flush service. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use.

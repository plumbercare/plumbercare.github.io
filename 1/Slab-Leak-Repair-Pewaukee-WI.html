<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

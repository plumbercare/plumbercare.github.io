<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Carlinville</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

One can be included for around $120 if you do not have one already set up close by.

<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>

You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, sometimes in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in place after detaching them. The brand-new pipe is just installed in the path of least resistance.

This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted effectively (Photo 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

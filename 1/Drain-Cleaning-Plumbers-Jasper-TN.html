<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>

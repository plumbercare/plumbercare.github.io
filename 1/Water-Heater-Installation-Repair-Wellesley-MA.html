<p>The most reliable way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Tankless units heat water as needed instead of all the time, just like older-style tank hot water heater. You can also fume water more quickly than with traditional heaters.

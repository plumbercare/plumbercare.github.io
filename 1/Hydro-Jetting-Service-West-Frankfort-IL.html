<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your safety, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. The most typical drain problem we are called for is concerns with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is slow to drain. Usually, drainage problems are a sign that there is a clog or build-up inside your drains which requires to be cleared out.

<h3>Bathtub Repair in West Frankfort Illinois</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts.

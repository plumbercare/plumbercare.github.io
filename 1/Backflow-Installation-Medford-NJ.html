Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>

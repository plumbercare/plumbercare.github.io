It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.

Adequate drainage must likewise be offered.</p>

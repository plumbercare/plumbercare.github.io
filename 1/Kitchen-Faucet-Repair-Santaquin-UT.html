<p>Water heater diagnostics: We determine what is incorrect with your hot water heater, as well as what maintenance work needs to be performed progressing. Water softeners generally utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved sodium chloride salt, likewise called brine. In the ion exchange procedure, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this method uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surfaces.

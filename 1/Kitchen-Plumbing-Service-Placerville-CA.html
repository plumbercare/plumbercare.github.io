<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself.

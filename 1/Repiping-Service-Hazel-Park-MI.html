<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. When searching for a new flapper, your best choice is to attempt and find the exact same flapper that initially included your existing flush valve.

If you don't know your design number, however, we do offer an extensive choice of "will fit" flappers to help you out.

<h3>Leak Detection in Baker City Oregon</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>

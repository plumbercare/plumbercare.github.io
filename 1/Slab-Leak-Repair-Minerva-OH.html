For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and eliminates from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

Your water will taste better. The minerals in tough water can cause a bad odor and taste. It removes the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes excellent when you add a water softener.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

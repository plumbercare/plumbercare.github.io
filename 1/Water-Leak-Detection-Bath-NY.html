<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might be able to fully or partly eliminate copper, radium, manganese, and iron, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Note that copper can reenter the water after if passes and leaves the softener through your house's pipes and plumbing.

<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. First, plans for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Turned down plans must be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>

Ability to Select Media for Custom Applications - Ships without media to give versatility in supplying solutions for various issue water scenarios.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complicated than replacing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires properly, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>

<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
